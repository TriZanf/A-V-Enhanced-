## UX
### Project Goals

The aim of the A&V website is to creat a fast and secure way for clients to connect with Arthur and Vernon Inc.
and be able to have access to the available services and offers that A&V provides.

### Customer Needs 

The potential clients in mind when creating this website was, people who travle alot, or enviromentally 
concscience residance of the city that the A&V vendor is located at that prefer car-pooling.

Needs in mind were:

1.  Offering affordable rates.
2.  Large selection of cars.
3.  Veriety of makes and models, including fuel, eg. petrol, gasoline, or electric.
4.  Demonstration of ease of access to local dealer and garages.
5.  Demonstration of local of the dealerships to make it easier for clients to pick up and drop off the rentals.

### Creator Goals

1. Developing a resposive website with the least amount of clutter to ease navigation.
2. Straight forward programming of the website to make it clear what the vendor has to offer.
3. Easy to read text and sentences explaining why A&V is a good option.
4. A task that inspires the developer and makes the job enjoable.

### Customer Stories

If I was a potential client I would like the website to:

1. Make it clear and intuitive how to nagivigate and make use of.
2. Have clear options that guide me through the proccess of making use of the services.
3. Be Visually apealing and have good layouts and color codes.
4. Make it easy to get in touch with a person and state questions or concerns, e.g phone numbers and addresses.


### Design picks 

The design of the logo is an imalgamation of A and V with an artistic twist! I feel like it will stick in the 
visitor's mind once they understand the refrence of the logo.

The design of the website itself; for example the coloring and shades was made to make the 
visitor feel welcome, and the dark theme to make it easy on the eye and creat a feeling of relaxation. 
I feel like the mix of black and blue brings about calmness and trust. So the buttons and overall
theme were centered around that.

The logos on the home-page were put there as a refrence to makes and models which are well known, and draws the 
visitor in.

### Wireframes

The overall planning and set up of the projects were hand designed and drawn on paper. Since I had this
project in mind for a while but was not familiar enough with wireframe providers. Pics of the drawing can
ofcourse be attached as snippets.
